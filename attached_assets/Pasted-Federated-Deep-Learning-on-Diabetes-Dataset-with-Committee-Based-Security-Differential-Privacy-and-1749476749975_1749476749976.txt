Federated Deep Learning on Diabetes Dataset with Committee-Based Security, Differential Privacy, and Visual Progress Interface 1. Simple Explanation Design a federated learning application in Python using deep learning, which learns to predict diabetes using the provided diabetes dataset. It incorporates secure distributed learning with: Committees: Small randomly chosen groups validate and aggregate model updates. Reputation: Each node gets a privacy-protected reputation score, promoting honest behavior. Differential Privacy: All reputation and sensitive update info is masked with random noise, shielding it from attackers. Together, these features secure the system from fake nodes (Sybil attacks) and malicious insiders (Byzantine attacks), and ensure data privacy. 2. Detailed Technical Specification (using your diabetes dataset) A. System Overview Initialize a federated network of n nodes, each using a portion of the diabetes data for training a deep learning model (e.g., using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch). Validation and aggregation are performed by rotating committees of nodes. Every node tracks its reputation (protected with differential privacy), recalculated after each communication round. Only nodes with the highest (DP-masked) reputations are eligible for committee selection. B. Workflow & Core Components 1. Node Reputation Management Monitor each node's actions—responsiveness, quality of updates, uptime, etc. Each round, update the reputation score and add Laplace or Gaussian noise to mask it before any sharing (implement ε-differential privacy). Only masked/aggregate reputation scores are visible to the network. 2. Committee Formation & Protocol Every communication round, form a new committee using probabilistic selection weighted by privacy-protected reputation. Each committee publishes a proof-of-membership via a hash or digital signature. Prevent nodes from manipulating their own probability of selection beyond their reputation. 3. Differential Privacy All broadcasts and committee announcements must use ε-differential privacy—inject noise when reporting scores/statistics or reputations. Tune privacy parameters to achieve a balance of privacy and transparency. 4. Security Defenses Sybil Attack Resistance: Discourage fake node creation by requiring sustained, honest participation to build reputation. Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Committees are rotated and formed using hidden reputations to reduce collusions. Privacy Preservation: No node can see exact reputations, only noisy/aggregate values. 5. Consensus & Action Phase Committees aggregate models (median, majority vote, or a robust averaging—can use Byzantine-robust algorithm if desired). Committees reach consensus (PBFT/HotStuff simulated protocol) and sign their decisions. All committee outputs are validated by the rest of the network. 3. Interface Requirements Create a simple interactive web interface (suggest Flask/Dash/Streamlit): Progress Bars: Step-by-step progress for each main phase (local training, reputation update, committee selection, aggregation, prediction). Statistics & Predictions: Real-time display of current round’s predicted diabetes risk and accuracy (bar/stats). Dynamic logs or status for each node: reputation bar, committee membership
