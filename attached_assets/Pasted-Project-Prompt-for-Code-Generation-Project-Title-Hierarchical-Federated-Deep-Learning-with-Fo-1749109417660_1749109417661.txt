Project Prompt (for Code Generation) **Project Title:** Hierarchical Federated Deep Learning with Fog-level Aggregation, Differential Privacy, and Committee-Based Security **Dataset:** Use `diabetes.csv` for all client nodes. --- ### Core Description - **Federated Setup:** - Simulate multiple clients, each with their own data partition from `diabetes.csv`. - Only clients execute training. - After local training, each client sends their updated (secret-shared) model weights to their assigned fog node. - **Fog nodes aggregate these updates** from their respective clients—fog nodes themselves DO NOT perform any training, only aggregation. - Among fogs, a single "leader fog" collects and performs global aggregation of all fog-level aggregates. - After each round, **leader fog sends the new global model weights to all clients**, who then start their next local training round using these updated global weights. - **Committee Protocol:** - Each round, form committees for secure validation and aggregation, using a reputation system (scores masked with differential privacy). - Committee members are chosen based on privacy-protected reputation scores. - All reputation-related stats shared or reported in the system are masked with Laplace or Gaussian noise (ε-differential privacy). - **Security:** - Protect against Sybil and Byzantine attacks using rotating random committees, DP-masked reputations, and aggregated updates. - No node has access to exact reputations—only noisy/aggregated values are visible. - **User Interface (Web Dashboard):** - Use Streamlit or Dash. - Tabs ("onglets") for: - Training Progress (with per-step progress bars for each round) - Fog/Committee Membership & Reputations - Aggregation Status - Real-time Predictions vs. Ground Truth - User controls for number of communication rounds and privacy parameter ε. - After each round, interface displays: - Progress of local training, fog aggregation, and global aggregation - Reputation bar for each client node - Committee membership for current round - Prediction results and accuracy - **Attack simulation toggle:** Present in the UI but marked as **incompatible with hierarchical fog setup (feature for future updates only)**. - **Framework File/README Request:** - Include a file (or doc string) that describes: - The role and communication of each entity (clients, fogs, leader fog, committees) - Methods used for aggregation, reputation scoring, privacy masking, and communication patterns - Each round’s workflow (clients train, send to fog, fogs aggregate, leader fog aggregates, leader sends to clients for next round) - Security and privacy mechanisms - Limitations (e.g. attack simulation not yet compatible with fog structure) - **Key Libraries:** - numpy, pandas, torch or tensorflow/keras, scikit-learn, streamlit/dash, matplotlib/plotly; diffprivlib or manual DP, secretsharing for secure communication. **Express**: - All code should be modular and well-commented - The simulation should visualize every main step and allow user control over core parameters - Documentation/readme must clearly outline structure, workflow, and future features --- **You may add:** - Sample user flow (from setup → progress → prediction) - Any best practices for modular coding/federated simulation in Python --- **Special Note:** For aggregation, **fog nodes only aggregate**—they do not train. After each aggregation, the round restarts at clients with the updated global model from the leader fog. **Attack simulation is not yet compatible with hierarchical fog. Include the UI option, but mark as “future update”.** --- This will direct a code generator or developer to produce precisely what you described. Let me know if you need a version focused on a specific file, a starter code template, or an English/French translation!

add matrix confusion and fog times execution and times of communication.

add patient prediction.

And show the result of the patient prediction 

Use this dataset and display progress bars in real time for rounds and execute clients in parallel.
I want to display in one progresse bar , and stop round until have the best accuracy, use diabetes.csv. use pre-processing , and use fedavg and fedprox algorithm to aggregation


End all rounds .

Correct the app when we have this error : Training round failed: name 'num_rounds' is not defined  
avoid this error : TypeError: Unable to convert function return value to a Python type! The signature was () -> handle
