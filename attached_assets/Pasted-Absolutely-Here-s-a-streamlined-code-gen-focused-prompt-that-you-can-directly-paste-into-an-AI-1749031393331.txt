Absolutely! Here’s a **streamlined, code-gen focused prompt** that you can directly paste into an AI coding assistant (like GPT-4, Claude, etc.) or give to a dev to clarify exactly what you need:

## Project Prompt (for Code Generation)

**Project Title:**  
Hierarchical Federated Deep Learning with Fog-level Aggregation, Differential Privacy, and Committee-Based Security

**Dataset:**  
Use `diabetes.csv` for all client nodes.

---

### Core Description

- **Federated Setup:**  
  - Simulate multiple clients, each with their own data partition from `diabetes.csv`.
  - Only clients execute training.  
  - After local training, each client sends their updated (secret-shared) model weights to their assigned fog node.
  - **Fog nodes aggregate these updates** from their respective clients—fog nodes themselves DO NOT perform any training, only aggregation.
  - Among fogs, a single "leader fog" collects and performs global aggregation of all fog-level aggregates.
  - After each round, **leader fog sends the new global model weights to all clients**, who then start their next local training round using these updated global weights.

- **Committee Protocol:**  
  - Each round, form committees for secure validation and aggregation, using a reputation system (scores masked with differential privacy).
  - Committee members are chosen based on privacy-protected reputation scores.
  - All reputation-related stats shared or reported in the system are masked with Laplace or Gaussian noise (ε-differential privacy).

- **Security:**  
  - Protect against Sybil and Byzantine attacks using rotating random committees, DP-masked reputations, and aggregated updates.
  - No node has access to exact reputations—only noisy/aggregated values are visible.

- **User Interface (Web Dashboard):**  
  - Use Streamlit or Dash.
  - Tabs ("onglets") for:
    - Training Progress (with per-step progress bars for each round)
    - Fog/Committee Membership & Reputations
    - Aggregation Status
    - Real-time Predictions vs. Ground Truth
  - User controls for number of communication rounds and privacy parameter ε.
  - After each round, interface displays:
    - Progress of local training, fog aggregation, and global aggregation
    - Reputation bar for each client node
    - Committee membership for current round
    - Prediction results and accuracy  
  - **Attack simulation toggle:** Present in the UI but marked as **incompatible with hierarchical fog setup (feature for future updates only)**.

- **Framework File/README Request:**  
  - Include a file (or doc string) that describes:
    - The role and communication of each entity (clients, fogs, leader fog, committees)
    - Methods used for aggregation, reputation scoring, privacy masking, and communication patterns
    - Each round’s workflow (clients train, send to fog, fogs aggregate, leader fog aggregates, leader sends to clients for next round)
    - Security and privacy mechanisms
    - Limitations (e.g. attack simulation not yet compatible with fog structure)

- **Key Libraries:**  
  - numpy, pandas, torch or tensorflow/keras, scikit-learn, streamlit/dash, matplotlib/plotly; diffprivlib or manual DP, secretsharing for secure communication.

**Express**:
- All code should be modular and well-commented
- The simulation should visualize every main step and allow user control over core parameters
- Documentation/readme must clearly outline structure, workflow, and future features

---

**You may add:**
- Sample user flow (from setup → progress → prediction)
- Any best practices for modular coding/federated simulation in Python

---

**Special Note:**  
For aggregation, **fog nodes only aggregate**—they do not train. After each aggregation, the round restarts at clients with the updated global model from the leader fog.  
**Attack simulation is not yet compatible with hierarchical fog. Include the UI option, but mark as “future update”.**
