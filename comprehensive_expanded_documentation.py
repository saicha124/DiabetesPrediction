    REGULARIZATION TECHNIQUES

    • Layer Normalization: Alternative for small batch sizes

    FEDERATED LOSS AGGREGATION
    
    Weighted Loss Aggregation:
    L_global = Σ(n_k/n) × L_k
    where L_k is local loss at client k, n_k is local dataset size
    
    Advanced Aggregation Strategies:
    
    1. Performance-Weighted Aggregation:
       w_k = (accuracy_k × reliability_k) / Σ(accuracy_j × reliability_j)
       L_global = Σw_k × L_k
    
    2. Uncertainty-Weighted Aggregation:
       w_k = 1 / (uncertainty_k + ε)
       where uncertainty_k is measured through prediction variance
    
    3. Gradient Norm Weighting:
       w_k = ||∇L_k|| / Σ||∇L_j||
       Emphasizes clients with significant learning signals
    
    CONVERGENCE OPTIMIZATION
    
    Multi-Objective Loss Optimization:
    The system balances multiple objectives simultaneously:
    
    1. Primary Objective: Classification accuracy
       L_accuracy = Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
    
    2. Privacy Objective: Information leakage minimization
       L_privacy = Mutual Information between features and updates
    
    3. Fairness Objective: Demographic parity
       L_fairness = |P(ŷ=1|A=0) - P(ŷ=1|A=1)|
       where A is sensitive attribute
    
    Combined Loss:
    L_total = α × L_accuracy + β × L_privacy + γ × L_fairness
    
    ADAPTIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES
    
    Learning Rate Scheduling for Loss Reduction:
    
    1. ReduceLROnPlateau:
       - Monitor validation loss for improvement
       - Reduce learning rate by factor (0.5-0.8) when plateauing
       - Patience parameter: 5-10 rounds without improvement
    
    2. Cyclical Learning Rates:
       lr(t) = lr_min + (lr_max - lr_min) × (1 + cos(π × t / T)) / 2
       Helps escape local minima and improves convergence
    
    3. Warm-up and Cool-down:
       - Linear warm-up: Gradually increase from 0 to target learning rate
       - Cool-down: Exponential decay in final training phases
       - Prevents early instability and enables fine-tuning
