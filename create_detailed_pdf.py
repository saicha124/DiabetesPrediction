    FEDERATED LEARNING FORMULATION:
    
    The global optimization problem is formulated as:
    minimize F(w) = sum over k of (n_k/n) * F_k(w)
    
    where:
    - F(w) is the global objective function
    - F_k(w) is the local objective function for client k
    - w represents global model parameters
    - n_k is the number of samples at client k
    - n is the total number of samples
    
    FEDAVG ALGORITHM:
    The Federated Averaging algorithm updates the global model as:
    w^(t+1) = sum over k of (n_k/n) * w_k^(t+1)
    
    FEDPROX ALGORITHM:
    Extends FedAvg with proximal regularization:
    F_k^(prox)(w) = F_k(w) + (μ/2) * ||w - w^(t)||²
    
    DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY:
    Gaussian mechanism adds noise with standard deviation:
    σ = sqrt(2 * ln(1.25/δ)) * Δf / ε
    
    where ε is the privacy parameter and δ is the failure probability.
